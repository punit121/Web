                             Zersey provides services to you that assist in the securing of beauty appointments at third party salons or spas. You generate an online request and we will determine availability of appointments at the time of your query. We will provide confirmation of your appointment via SMS or email. By using Zersey’s Services, you agree to receive appointment confirmation, reminders, and review requests via SMS or email after the time at which an appointment is booked. 
<br>
The Services are being offered to you for your personal use. You agree to use the Services only to book appointments at salon and then honor those appointments by arriving at the salon on time and paying for the service upon receipt of that service. Resale or attempted resale of appointments is prohibited, and is grounds for, among other things, removal of your ability to book future appointments via Zersey. Zersey expressly reserves all its rights and remedies under applicable law. 
<br>
Any and all other uses which are unlawful or in violation of this Agreement's terms and conditions are prohibited. Zersey reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel appointments.

                            Zersey is committed to providing superior quality services to its users and salon/ spas. To assist us in maintaining a consistently high level of service with the salon/ spas and patrons, users are asked to cancel any appointments that they will be unable to honor at least 24 hours in advance. We require that consumers contact the salon directly via phone call for cancellations or changes within 24 hours of the appointment time. 
<br>
If you are unable to keep your appointment and you fail to cancel, Zersey will send you an email letting you know that our records indicate that you were a no-show. By using the Services, you agree to receive no-show confirmations by email after a salon and/or the Zersey Site reports your appointment was not honored, whether or not that was in fact the case. Be advised that you will not be able to make further appointments via Zersey if you no-show for three appointments within the same twelve-month period. All final no-show determinations will be made by Zersey in its sole discretion.
